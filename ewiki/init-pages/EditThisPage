There is a [EditThisPage]Link at the bottom of every page. Just click
on it to edit the currently shown page.

You'll see a large input box appear with the current content inside.
Just make your additions or fix some typing errors and push the ![Save]
button.

You do not need to register or something else to use this function!

Now go to the SandBox or NotePad to play a bit.
