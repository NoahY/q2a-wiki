In PHP5 beta2 some stupid introduced a 'bugfix' to make the array_merge()
function refuse to proceed when undefined parameters get passed (the NULL
value) instead of automatically typecasting it into an empty array like
previous versions did. This makes ewiki break, because the array_merge()
is used to create AND collapse arrays all over the code.

If you wish to use ewiki with this early BETA version, then you have to
recompile your PHP interpreter. Go into your php source directory and open
"ext/standard/array.c" for editing. There you'll need to find the line
containing:
			params_ok = 0;

Just uncomment this and recompile your interpreter, so array_merge() works
as before, but of a warning message. In the line above this one you should
also change the E_WARNING to E_NOTICE if your error log fills up too fast.

Interesting resources on this issue are:
- http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=25494  (AKA the broken bug report)
- http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/php-src/ext/standard/array.c
- http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-dev&m=106561879428591&w=2

Note: the discussion about this major feature change (namely introducing
"strong typing" into the PHP scripting language) got quiet currently, so
please visit http://bugs.php.net/ if you anticipate this new development
direction too. Add a complaint NOW, if the php interpreter ships like it
currently is, we'll never get a working version again!
