To make clickable images, we'll need to patch the ewiki_link_regex_callback()
function. It must recall itself to get images rendered as links.
However I personally would vote against such functions, as Wiki is a
hyperTEXT system based upon the HTML (HyperTextMarkupLanguage) - which is
obviously not the same as a HPML (HyperPictureMarkupLanguage).


- edit ewiki.php
- search for "function ewiki_link_regex_callb"
- after the code block "#-- anchors\n..." insert:

   #-- image links
   if (strpos($title, "://")) {
      $tmp_img = ewiki_link_regex_callback(array("[$title]"));
      if (strpos($tmp_img, "<img") === 0) {
         $title = $tmp_img;
      }
   }

- save and test your changed ewiki.php


To get a clickable image, then just write in your WikiPages something like:
[http://www.google.com/ "http://images.org/pic1.png"]
